            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead">“The schizophrenic mind is not so much split as shattered. I like to say schizophrenia is like a waking nightmare.”(Saks) There are times where you can’t really explain what Schizophrenia really is and that is simply because it is a very rare chronic disorder that runs a chronic and relapsing course. How well is Schizophrenia truly understood? What are the thinking process behind this disorder? Is it a multi personality disorder? What are the events that lead to this disorder? Does having schizophrenia really impact a person's life to able to socialize and complete ordinary tasks while having a schizophrenic disorder? &nbsp;<div>In today’s society every individual that has Schizophrenia can experience different types of symptoms because schizophrenia can vary between hallucinations, delusions, disorders, and other various types of disorders. These disabilities can truly impact an individual's life mostly because they are unable to cope with this disorder.  It can also affect a person's inability to function properly.  Schizophrenic individuals struggle to carry on conversions on important aspects of ordinary tasks. “Worldwide about 1 percent of the population is diagnosed with schizophrenia, and approximately 1.2% of Americans (3.2 million) have the disorder.”(Patel V).  Schizophrenia worldwide is pretty rare  because scientists do not know understand whether&nbsp;</div></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>&nbsp;Schizophrenia is caused in genes or because of the environment. “Scientists believe that many different genes contribute to an increased risk of schizophrenia, but that no single gene causes the disorder by itself.” (NIMH). Scientist also believe that chemical reactions in the brain play a role in schizophrenia leading to dopamine neurotransmitters that may be the cause of affecting the brain in  many ways due to the brain to having more activity in one area more than the other area.  Many would also believe that pre-birth might also be a leading cause to schizophrenia during the development of the brain that could trigger psychotic symptoms to people who are vulnerable due to various developments before birth. All of these scientific discoveries could lead to schizophrenia, but more research is needed to find the probable cause of schizophrenia.  Therefore causing many questions in the scientific community on what might cause this type of disorder.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, there are individuals in today’s society that believe schizophrenia to be a split personality disorder, but that is not true simply because both disorders are completely different than one another.  Individuals suffer with Schizophrenia are prone to hallucinations, delusions and can barely finish thoughts or sentences they are trying to explain.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4 lead"><p>That reason being is because people who have schizophrenia experience auditory hallucinations that impair their cognitive thinking.Dissociative identity disorder on the other hand, involves multi personalities in the same person, without the person realizing it, which can be caused by trauma or other various types of psychologically disabilities. Schizophrenia is more likely to occur from genes than enviroment, but no one really knows what truly causes it. Having this disorders can truly impact the way an individual would socialize in society.</p><p>All in all, Schizophrenia in today’s society is misunderstood, and impacts the way a certain individual would socialize in society due to the symptoms that a certain schizophrenic individual might have. The scientific research of schizophrenia also varies across the research community because there are various variables of what causes schizophrenia leading to problems on finding a cure and a treatment to schizophrenia. Misperceptions of what schizophrenia is and what causes it could lead to problems within a society because it can affect the way an individual with schizophrenia is treated and how they are able to socialize in society.</p><p><br></p></div>
